AIDANEWS2_INSTALLED_OR_UPDATED_SUCCESSFULLY="<div style="_QQ_"text-align: center; width: 100%; float: right;"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/aida2logo.jpg"_QQ_"/></div><br/>AiDaNews is back! AiDaNews2 is the next step for an easy and versatile Joomla! Module that lets everyone, from experts to novice webmasters, show their articles in an appealing and highly-customizable way.<br/><br/>The module has been rewritten from scratch originating from Joomla!'s own latestnews module which resulted in a much more elegant and lightweight code. Now AiDaNews follows the MVC pattern (the articles are retrieved in a helper file and displayed using a template file), passes the W3C code check without an error, uses CSS files instead of style tags (but maintains the possibility of styling the module right from the backend!), has CSS classes for every element (and even special classes for first/last element and such) and is overall a much more reliable and correct module from the code point of view.<br/><br/>This isn't only a 'debug' though: AiDaNews2 has lots of new features that will make the users' life easier. Pre-made styles will rapidly make the module match every site, and will allow experts to create their own configurations that can be shared between groups of modules making maintenance easier. Layout positions have been extended from 5 to 9, and their appearance and position can be changed through CSS with endless possibilities. The module now uses a CSS file, but CSS can also be inserted from the module's backend (and you can even use a CSS file and then add some additional CSS rules for each individual instance). The module's backend has been slightly modified to be easier to navigate: tabs have been divided into categories, and their titles are now more descriptive. The module contains many more additions: secondary ordering, up to three images that can be individually linked to articles, profiles, categories and so on, tableless grid layout... and all the options that made AiDaNews so unique.<br/><br/>So here's AiDaNews2: a complete debug and adjustment/improvement of the first iteration of the module, with the addition of many useful options that will satisfy any need. Everything now has the simplicity of descriptive tips right in the backend, or (finally!) the possibility to read through a huge amount of FAQs and explanations in the Module's Documentation on Aimini.it.<br/><br/>As always, feel free to contact me! Here's some useful links to have your questions answered.<br/><br/><div style="_QQ_"text-align: center; width: 100%;"_QQ_"><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Documentation::Learn more about AiDaNews2 Settings!"_QQ_" href="_QQ_"http://aimini.it/en/documentation"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/docs.jpg"_QQ_"/></a><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Website::My other projects on my Website"_QQ_" href="_QQ_"http://www.aimini.it"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/web.jpg"_QQ_"/></a><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Forums::Get your questions answered!"_QQ_" href="_QQ_"http://www.aimini.it/forum"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/forums.jpg"_QQ_"/></a><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"E-mail::Contact me if you need something more specific, or you need to solve a bug."_QQ_" href="_QQ_"mailto:dan@cdh.it?subject=[AiDaNews2] Your Subject"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/mail.jpg"_QQ_"/></a><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Donate::AiDaNews is free, but you can support the developer with a small donation."_QQ_" href="_QQ_"http://www.aimini.it/"_QQ_"><img src="_QQ_"../modules/mod_aidanews2/img/donate.jpg"_QQ_"/></a><a class="_QQ_"hasTip"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"Rate on the JED::Like the module?
